      <h1> Hecklr </h1>
      <h2 id="slogan"> The Group Watch Platform by Jason Morris </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2> Abstract </h2>
          <p> A service that allows the group watch of content such as Youtube videos. Hecklr allows large group of viewers to be able to sync video playback for all. Complete with chat integration and on screen doodling, allowing great moments of humor as they group watch their favorite videos.</p>  
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2> High Level Concept </h2>
          <p> Using Youtube's API and Websocket to sync, Hecklr will let a group of users to coordinate syncing a video. Once a video is synced an started, real time chat features and on screen drawing will let the users express themselves as they watch the video together. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2> User Experience | Mechanics</h2>
          <p> Youtube's API is capable of loading the same video for each user in the room. Once the video is loaded, each user will ready up. Once a certain percentage of users in the room have readied, the server will send the command for each client to play the video at the same time. If a new user joins during the middle of a viewing, the server will get the current playback time and send the current time to the new users so their video will match the other users' playback.<p>
          <p> During a playback, every user can interact in two ways, real time chat and on screen drawing. For chatting, a message will be sent to the server that will get dispatched to all the other users in the room. The drawing function will let users draw crud line art on top of the video playback for all to see, so you can give all your favorite Youtube celebs fancy moustaches and write funny thought bubbles for how they really feel. </p>       
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2> Client | Server Breakdown </h2>
          <p> The Client will be web based and use JavaScript and HTML for loading videos, interacting with the API, and the server/client coding. <p>
          <p> The Server will use Websockets and JavaScript while running on NodeJS. The server will group the users into rooms where once they are added they will get the current video/Youtube link from the Server's video queue. The server will then wait for ready ups from each user. Once enough readys are reach, the server will send the OK to each client and they will all start the video (weather they want to or not). If any new users join, the server will send the current video time (which it's been keeping track of) so that the new user can hop right in where everyone else is. </p>
          <p> The Server will also handle the passing of chat messages and the Canvas element that will used for the on screen drawing to everyone in the room so they can see what each other is saying and drawing. <p>
        </li>

          <h2> Mockup <h2>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2> Libraries </h2>
          <p> Going to be using Youtube's API to get access to the video player's controls and things like the current video time and seekTo functions. Should also make it possible to have it so I can fetch videos by their URL and load them to the screen for everyone. </p> 
          <p> Might use other libraries, but can't think of any more as of right now. </p>        
         </li>
        <li>
          <h2> Controls and Assets Needed </h2>
          <P> The controls will be mostly mouse based except for the chat typing. Videos can be added to the queue by copy and pasting a URL to the page. Drawing is done by clicking a color then using the mouse on the screen. Chatting will work by clicking the chat box then typing your message, with enter being the send prompt.<p>
          <p> The video will of course come from Youtube (maybe Twitch VODS aswell?). For assets, the only ones I'll need are for the UI such as the audience outline at the bottom of the page and the text bubbles for the chatters. Besides that, the only asset left will be the design of the color picker. </p>
